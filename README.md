# MIPS 32-bit 5-Stage Pipelined Processor

This project is a 32-bit MIPS-based processor built using Verilog. It implements a 5-stage pipeline: **IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB**. It also includes support for **forwarding**, **branch**, and **jump** instructions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 5-stage pipelined datapath
- Supports ALU operations, memory access, branching, and jumping
- Implements **data hazard resolution** via a forwarding unit
- Testbench with multiple instruction sequences
- Waveform verification using GTKWave/ModelSim
